# ðŸ—º Path to Backend: C# Project Roadmap

A personal roadmap for building over 15 progressively more advanced C# applications â€” starting from simple console apps and moving toward fully functional ASP.NET Core APIs with database support.

## ðŸš© LEVEL 1: Absolute Basics â€” Console Applications (No Web, Just C#)

Covers the fundamentals of the language and logic through simple console applications.

1. **Number Guessing Game**  
Console asks the user to guess a number between 1â€“100.

2. **Simple Calculator**  
Performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input.

3. **To-Do List Console App**  
Enables users to add, list, and remove tasks.

4. **Bank Account Simulator**  
Simulates account creation, deposit, withdrawal, and balance check.

5. **Student Grades Manager**  
Manages student names and grades, and calculates averages.

## ðŸš© LEVEL 2: Intermediate Console Apps (OOP + LINQ + Basic File I/O)

Introduces structured data, file operations, and more complex class relationships.

6. **Library System (Console)**  
Allows managing a collection of books and simulates borrowing and returning.

7. **Expense Tracker**  
Lets users log expenses and displays summaries.

8. **File Organizer Tool**  
Sorts files into folders based on type or date.

9. **Quiz Game**  
Loads questions from a file, presents them, and shows the final score.

## ðŸš© LEVEL 3: First Web API with ASP.NET Core

Marks the transition from local applications to web-based APIs.

10. **Hello World Web API**  
A single-endpoint API returning a welcome message.

11. **To-Do API**  
A RESTful API version of the console To-Do app using in-memory storage.

12. **User Registration API**  
Allows user registration and login with mock logic.

13. **Basic Notes API**  
CRUD operations on notes using a lightweight database like SQLite.

---

## ðŸš© LEVEL 4: More Structured + Real Use Cases

Focuses on realistic APIs with multiple models, database integration, and clean architecture.

14. **Task Manager API (with DB)**  
Projects with nested tasks, including database persistence.

15. **Blog API**  
Handles blog posts, comments, and categories with filtering and pagination.

16. **Fitness Log API**  
Tracks workouts with features like summaries and grouping by month.
